Number of nodes: 20
Max simulation time: 100000 seconds

Transactions:

Number of transactions: 730

Time unit: 600s
Mining winners: the winners are randomly selected from the nodes pool. Only 3 winners at most within a time unit.
Winners always generate new block no matter whether the incomplete transaction list is empty.

Output files:
Nodes_blockchain.txt: displays the blockchain of each node

statistics.txt: shows the statistics from the simulator.
It displays all the blockchains exist in the simulator, and the owners for each blockchain.
